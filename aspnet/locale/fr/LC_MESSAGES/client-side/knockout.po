"Knockout is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of "
"complex data-based user interfaces. It can be used alone or with other "
"libraries, such as jQuery. Its primary purpose is to bind UI elements to an "
"underlying data model defined as a JavaScript object, such that when changes"
" are made to the UI, the model is updated, and vice versa. Knockout "
"facilitates the use of a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern in a web "
"application's client-side behavior. The two main concepts one must learn "
"when working with Knockout's MVVM implementation are Observables and "
"Bindings."

"Knockout is deployed as a single JavaScript file, so installing and using it"

"You may already be familiar with using JavaScript to manipulate elements on "
"a web page, either via direct access to the DOM or using a library like "
"jQuery. Typically this kind of behavior is achieved by writing code to "
"directly set element values in response to certain user actions. With "
"Knockout, a declarative approach is taken instead, through which elements on"
" the page are bound to properties on an object. Instead of writing code to "
"manipulate DOM elements, user actions simply interact with the ViewModel "
"object, and Knockout takes care of ensuring the page elements are "
"synchronized."

"As a simple example, consider the page list below. It includes a ``<span>`` "
"element with a ``data-bind`` attribute indicating that the text content "
"should be bound to authorName. Next, in a JavaScript block a variable "

"value. Finally, a call to ``ko.applyBindings`` is made, passing in this "
"viewModel variable."

"We now have simple one-way binding working. Notice that nowhere in the code "

"The issue is that nothing notified the ``<span>`` that it needed to be "

"**observables** in the ViewModel for any properties that need to have "
"changes automatically updated as they occur. By changing the ViewModel to "
"use ``ko.observable(\"value\")`` instead of just \"value\", the ViewModel "

"Knockout supports a number of different kinds of bindings. So far we've seen"

"Knockout includes bindings that can perform conditional and looping "

"automatically update the UI elements when items are added or removed from "
"the array, without re-creating every element in the UI tree. The following "
"example uses a new viewModel which includes an observable array of game "
"results. It is bound to a simple table with two columns using a ``foreach`` "

"sets by tracking UI elements and only processing changes to affected "
"elements. Large applications can break up UI logic using templates and "
"components, which can be loaded on demand from external files. Currently "
"version 3, Knockout is a stable JavaScript library that can improve web "
