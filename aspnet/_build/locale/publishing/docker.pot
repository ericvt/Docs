msgid "This example shows you how to use the Visual Studio 2015 RC Tools for Docker extension to publish an ASP.NET 5 app to an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine (referred to here as a Docker host) on Azure with the Docker extension installed along with an ASP.NET 5 web application. You can publish the app to a new Docker host hosted on Azure, or to an on-premise server, Hyper-V, or Boot2Docker host by using the **Custom Host** setting. After publishing your app to a Docker host, you can use Docker command-line tools to interact with the container your app has been published to."
