msgid ""
"One nice feature of ReStructuredText is its ability to reference external "
"files. This allows actual sample source files to be referenced from "
"documentation articles, reducing the chances of the documentation content "
"getting out of sync with the actual, working code sample (assuming the code "
"sample works, of course). However, if documentation articles are referencing"
" samples by filename and line number, it is important that the documentation"
" articles be reviewed whenever changes are made to the source code, "
"otherwise these references may be broken or point to the wrong line number. "
"For this reason, it is recommended that samples be specific to individual "
"articles, so that updates to the sample will only affect a single article "
"(at most, an article series could reference a common sample). Samples should"
" therefore be placed in a subfolder named the same as the article file, in a"
" ``sample`` folder (e.g. ``/article-name/sample/``)."
