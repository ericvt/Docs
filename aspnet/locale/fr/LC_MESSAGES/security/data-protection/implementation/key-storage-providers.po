"By default the data protection system :ref:`employs a heuristic <data-"
"protection-default-settings>` to determine where cryptographic key material "
"should be persisted. The developer can override the heuristic and manually "
"specify the location."

"If you specify an explicit key persistence location, the data protection "
"system will deregister the default key encryption at rest mechanism that the"
" heuristic provided, so keys will no longer be encrypted at rest. It is "
"recommended that you additionally :ref:`specify an explicit key encryption "
"mechanism <data-protection-implementation-key-encryption-at-rest-providers>`"
" for production applications."

"We anticipate that the majority of applications will use a file system-based"

"The DirectoryInfo can point to a directory on the local machine, or it can "
"point to a folder on a network share. If pointing to a directory on the "
"local machine (and the scenario is that only applications on the local "
"machine will need to use this repository), consider using :ref:`Windows "
"DPAPI <data-protection-implementation-key-encryption-at-rest>` to encrypt "
"the keys at rest. Otherwise consider using an :ref:`X.509 certificate <data-"

"Sometimes the application might not have write access to the file system. "
"Consider a scenario where an application is running as a virtual service "
"account (such as w3wp.exe's app pool identity). In these cases, the "
"administrator may have provisioned a registry key that is appropriate ACLed "
"for the service account identity. Call the PersistKeysToRegistry "
