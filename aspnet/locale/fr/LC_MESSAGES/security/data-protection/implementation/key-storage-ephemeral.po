"There are scenarios where an application needs a throwaway "
"IDataProtectionProvider. For example, the developer might just be "
"experimenting in a one-off console application, or the application itself is"
" transient (it's scripted or a unit test project). To support these "
"scenarios the package Microsoft.AspNet.DataProtection includes a type "
"EphemeralDataProtectionProvider. This type provides a basic implementation "
"of IDataProtectionProvider whose key repository is held solely in-memory and"
" isn't written out to any backing store."

"Each instance of EphemeralDataProtectionProvider uses its own unique master "
"key. Therefore, if an IDataProtector rooted at an "
"EphemeralDataProtectionProvider generates a protected payload, that payload "
"can only be unprotected by an equivalent IDataProtector (given the same "
":ref:`purpose <data-protection-consumer-apis-purposes>` chain) rooted at the"
" same EphemeralDataProtectionProvider instance."
