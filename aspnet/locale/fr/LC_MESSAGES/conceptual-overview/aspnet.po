"ASP.NET 5 is a new open-source and cross-platform framework for building "
"modern cloud-based Web applications using .NET. We built it from the ground "
"up to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are either "
"deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. It consists of modular components "
"with minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your "
"solutions. You can develop and run your ASP.NET 5 applications cross-"
"platform on Windows, Mac and Linux. ASP.NET 5 is fully open source on "

"With ASP.NET 5 we are making a number of architectural changes that make the"
" core web framework much leaner and more modular. ASP.NET 5 is no longer "
"based on System.Web.dll, but is instead based on a set of granular and well "
"factored NuGet packages allowing you to optimize your app to have just what "
"you need. You can reduce the surface area of your application to improve "
"security, reduce your servicing burden and also to improve performance in a "
"true pay-for-what-you-use model."
