"It's a best practice to confirm the email of a new user registration to "

"\"joe@contoso.com\". Without email confirmation, \"joe@contoso.com\" could "
"get unwanted email from your app. Suppose Bob accidentally registered as  "
"\"bib@example.com\" and hadn't noticed it, he wouldn't be able to use "
