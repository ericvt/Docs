"The data protection code base includes a package "
"Microsoft.AspNet.Cryptography.KeyDerivation which contains cryptographic key"
" derivation functions. This package is technically its own standalone "
"component, has no dependencies on the rest of the data protection system, "
"and can be used completely independently. (Though this package is "
"technically not part of the data protection system, its source exists "
"alongside the data protection code base as a convenience.)"

"The package currently offers a method KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2 which allows "
"hashing a password using the `PBKDF2 algorithm "
"<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898#section-5.2>`_. This API is very "
"similar to the .NET Framework's existing `Rfc2898DeriveBytes type "
"<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-"
"us/library/System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes(v=vs.110).aspx>`_,"
" but there are three important distinctions:"

"The KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2 method supports consuming multiple PRFs (currently "
"HMACSHA1, HMACSHA256, and HMACSHA512), whereas the Rfc2898DeriveBytes type "
"only supports HMACSHA1."

"The KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2 method detects the current operating system and "
"attempts to choose the most optimized implementation of the routine, "
"providing much better performance in certain cases. (On Windows 8, it offers"
" around 10x the throughput of Rfc2898DeriveBytes.)"

"The KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2 method requires the caller to specify all "
"parameters (salt, PRF, and iteration count). The Rfc2898DeriveBytes type "
"provides default values for these."
