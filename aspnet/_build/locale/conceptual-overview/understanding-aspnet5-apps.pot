msgid "ASP.NET 5 introduces several new fundamental concepts of web programming that are important to understand in order to productively create web apps. These concepts are not necessarily new to web programming in general, but are new to ASP.NET and thus are likely new to many developers whose experience with web programming has mainly been using ASP.NET and Visual Studio."

msgstr ""

#: ..\..\conceptual-overview\understanding-aspnet5-apps.rst:28
msgid "The first thing you may notice about this new structure is that it includes a Solution Items folder with a *global.json* file, and the web project itself is located within a *src* folder within the solution. The new structure also includes a special *wwwroot* folder and a Dependencies section in addition to the References section that was present in past versions of ASP.NET (but which has been updated in this version). In the root the project there are also several new files such as *bower.json, appsettings.json, gulpfile.js, package.json, project.json*, and *Startup.cs*. You may notice that the files *global.asax, packages.config*, and *web.config* are gone. In previous versions of ASP.NET, a great deal of application configuration was stored in these files and in the project file. In ASP.NET 5, this information and logic has been refactored into files that are generally smaller and more focused."

msgid "ASP.NET 5 can target multiple frameworks, allowing the application to be deployed into different hosting environments. By default applications will target the full version of .NET, but they can also target the .NET Core. Most legacy apps will target the full ASP.NET 5, at least initially, since they're likely to have dependencies that include framework base class libraries that are not available in .NET Core today. .NET Core is a small version of the .NET framework that is optimized for web apps and supports Linux and Mac environments. It can be deployed with an application, allowing multiple apps on the same server to target different versions of .NET Core. It is also modular, allowing additional functionality to be added only when it is required, as separate NuGet packages (:doc:`learn more about .NET Core <dotnetcore>`)."

msgid "In previous versions of ASP.NET, the root of the project was typically the root of the website. If you placed a *Default.aspx* file in the project root of an early version of ASP.NET, it would load if a request was made to the web applicationâ€™s root. In later versions of ASP.NET, support for routing was added, making it possible to decouple the locations of files from their corresponding URLs (thus, HomeController in the Controllers folder is able to serve requests made to the root of the site, using a default route implementation). However, this routing  was used only for ASP.NET-specific application logic, not static files needed by the client to properly render the resulting page. Resources like images, script files, and stylesheets were generally still loaded based on their location within the file structure of the application, based off of the root of the project."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\conceptual-overview\understanding-aspnet5-apps.rst:106
msgid "The file based approach presented several problems. First, protecting sensitive project files required framework-level protection of certain filenames or extensions, to prevent having things like *web.config* or *global.asax* served to a client in response to a request. Having to specifically block access (also know as blacklisting) to certain files is much less secure than granting access only to those files which should be accessible(also known as whitelisting). Typically different versions were required for dev/test and production (for example *web.config*).  Scripts would typically be referenced individually and in a readable format during development, but would be minified and bundled together when deployed for production. Itâ€™s beneficial to deploy only production files to production, but handling these kinds of scenarios was difficult with the previous file structure."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\conceptual-overview\understanding-aspnet5-apps.rst:108
msgid "Enter the *wwwroot* folder in ASP.NET 5. The *wwwroot* folder represents the actual root of the web app when running on a web server. Static files, like *appsettings.json*, which are not located in *wwwroot* will never be accessible, and there is no need to create special rules to block access to sensitive files. Instead of blacklisting access to sensitive files, a more secure whitelist approach is taken whereby only those files in the *wwwroot* folder are accessible via web requests."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\conceptual-overview\understanding-aspnet5-apps.rst:110

Within each framework target, you will find individual references, with icons indicating whether the reference is to an assembly, a NuGet package, or a project.

msgid "ASP.NET 5 has decomposed its feature set into a variety of modules that can be individually added to a web app. This allows for lean web apps that do not import or bring in features they don't use. When your ASP.NET app starts, the ASP.NET runtime calls ``Configure`` in the ``Startup`` class. If you create a new ASP.NET web project using the Empty template, you will find that the *Startup.cs* file has only a couple lines of code. The default Web projectâ€™s ``Startup`` class wires up configuration, MVC, EF, Identity services, logging, routes, and more. It provides a good example for how to configure the services used by your ASP.NET app. There are three parts to the sample startup class: a constructor, ``ConfigureServices``, and ``Configure``. The ``Configure`` method is called after ``ConfigureServices`` and is used to configure middleware."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\conceptual-overview\understanding-aspnet5-apps.rst:236
msgid "The constructor specifies how configuration will be handled by the app. Configuration is a property of the ``Startup`` class and can be read from a variety of file formats as well as from environment variables. The default project template uses a ``ConfigurationBuilder`` to create a ``IConfiguration`` that loads *appsettings.json* and environment variables."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\conceptual-overview\understanding-aspnet5-apps.rst:251
msgid "The ``ConfigureServices`` method is used to specify which services are available to the app. The default template uses helper methods to add a variety of services used for EF, Identity, and MVC. This is also where you can add your own services, as we did above to expose the configuration as a service. The complete ``ConfigureServices`` method, including the call to add ``Configuration`` as a service, is shown here:"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\conceptual-overview\understanding-aspnet5-apps.rst:273
msgid "Finally, the ``Configure`` method will be called by the runtime after ``ConfigureServices``. In the sample project, ``Configure`` is used to wire up a console logger, add several useful features for the development environment, add support for static files, Identity, and MVC routing. Note that adding Identity and MVC in ``ConfigureServices`` isnâ€™t sufficient - they also need to be configured in  the request pipeline via these calls in ``Configure``."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\conceptual-overview\understanding-aspnet5-apps.rst:314

msgid "Summary"
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\conceptual-overview\understanding-aspnet5-apps.rst:321
msgid "ASP.NET 5 introduces a few concepts that didn't exist in previous versions of ASP.NET. Rather than working with *web.config*, packages.config, and a variety of project properties stored in the .csproj/.vbproj file, developers can now work with specific files and folders devoted to specific purposes. Although at first there is some learning curve, the end result is more secure, more maintainable, works better with source control, and has better separation of concerns than the approach used in previous versions of ASP.NET."
